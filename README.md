# hello-world
Miscellanous repository


I hope nobody reads these things, but just in case, here I am, trying to rediscover GitHub even if I have passed already half of my life using it.

This repository will contain different files with different purposes. Normally, config files and useful script tips that I will find over time. I hope that in a couple of years this repository will be completelly filled
